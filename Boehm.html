	<h1>Adam Boehm</h1>
	<p>Hello everyone! My favorite hobbies and activities include gaming, watching movies, and programming.<br>
	I have been a gamer pretty much my whole life, and I will continue to be for the rest cause I love it!<br>
	I am really enjoying <em>some</em> of my college classes, mainly the few where I actually write code.</p>
