<h3>Benefits in Depth</h3>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Education Benefits</strong> you say?<br><p>Yes, the Military across all branches encourages the soldier to pursue Civilian Education. While serving, you will have access to up to $4,500 a year in Tuition Assitance.
					Tuition Assitance is paid directly to the school you are attending on a per class basis. <br>There is also the Post-9/11 GI Bill and the Montgomery GI Bill. Both are intended for the soldier to pursue education <strong>after</strong>
					they have finished serving. The table below provides a brief summary on education benefits.</p></li>
		<table>
			<tr>
				<th>Program</th>
				<th>Description</th>
				<th>Eligibility</th>
				<th>Benefits</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Tuition Assistance (TA)</td>
				<td>TA is used while serving. It will pay the college directly and cover most if not all of the tuition on a per class basis.</td>
				<td>All servicemembers are eligible for TA. The criteria for eligibility is determined by each branch, and each company commander may differ.</td>
				<td>TA covers up to 100% tuition and fees. Not to exceed:
					<ul>
						<li>$250 per Semester credit hour</li>
						<li>$166 per Quarter credit hour</li>
						<li>$4,500 per fiscal year</li>
					</ul></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Post-9/11 GI Bill</td>
				<td>The Post-9/11 provides up to 36 months (that's 4 school years, 4 months per semester = 8 months per "year") of education benefits to the servicemember and veterans for:
					<ul>
						<li>College</li>
						<li>Technical Schools</li>
						<li>Correspondence Courses</li>
						<li>Apprenticeship/Job Training</li>
						<li>Flight School</li>
						<li>Licensing and Testing programs</li>
						<li>Certifications</li>
					</ul></td>
				<td>Servicemembers and Veterans who served at least 90 days on active duty (Active Duty, Reserve, National Guard) since 9/10/2001. The Post-9/11 can also be transferred from the servicemember to a family member.</td>
				<td>Paid tuition and fees, living stipend and book stipend. Individuals
					who qualify are eligible to recieve Basic Housing Allowance (BAH) 
					which depends on the Cost of Living for the area of the school. 
					Here is a BAH calculator
					<a href="http://www.defensetravel.dod.mil/site/bahCalc.cfm" target="_blank">DefenseTravel</a><br><br>
					The Post-9/11 comes in a tiered qualifying list depending on how 
					long the servicemember served on duty. The tiered list and more 
					information can be found at <a href="http://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill/comparison_tool/about_this_tool.asp"

				<td>The MGIB provides up to 36 months (4 school years, 4 months per semester = 8 months per "year") of education benefits to the servicemember and veterans for:
					<ul>
						<li>College, Business</li>
						<li>Technical and Vocational Courses</li>
						<li>Correspondence Courses</li>
						<li>Apprenticeship/Job Training</li>
						<li>Flight Training</li>
					<ul></td>

						<li>You contributed $100 a month for the first 12 months you are on active duty</li>
						<li>Completed High school or an equivalent certificate</li>
					</ul></td>
				<td>The Montgomery GI Bill can be worth of $66k. It is based on the 
					monthly full-time student payment rate of $1,857 multiplied by the 
					36 month limit. It is determined by your student status (full-time, 
					part-time) and your duty status. <br>While the Post-9/11 GI Bill and the 
					MGIB may sound similar, they are very different. A good comparison tool can be found here <a href="http://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill/comparison_tool.asp" target="_blank">benefits.va.gov</a></td>

			<tr>
				<td>Loan Repayment (LRP)</td>

		<li><strong>30 Days Paid Vacation</strong><br>	
			<p>While serving in the Military, you will earn 2.5 days of leave per month totalling to 30 days of paid leave per year. 
				Most of the time, you can take this leave at your leisure. You must get approval from your direct supervisor and company commander first.</p>
		</li>	
		<li><strong>World Travel</strong><br>	
			<p>The US Military across all branches has duty stations across the globe. From the United States, to Japan, to Europe, and to South America. Each branch has duty stations around the world, and if you choose to join, you may be stationed
				in one of these areas. You can travel the world with your family and see things you more than likely never would have seen before.</p></li>
		<li><strong>Healthcare in the Military</strong><br>
			<p>Healthcare is provided at a very affordable rate available for all branches across the US Military. There are three programs to choose from 
				<a href="http://www.military.com/benefits/tricare/prime/tricare-prime-overview.html" target="_blank">TRICARE Prime</a>,
				<a href="http://www.military.com/benefits/tricare/extra/tricare-extra-overview.html" target="_blank">TRICARE Extra</a>,
				and <a href="http://www.military.com/benefits/tricare/standard/tricare-standard-overview.html" target="_blank">TRICARE Standard</a>.
				Active Duty servicemembers are automatically enrolled into TRICARE Prime, while others may choose from the options.</p></li>
		<li><strong>Housing</strong><br>
			<p>Housing in the Military is a phenominal thing, one that the Military takes great care of. If you are married, married with kids, or single with kids, you are eligible to live rent-free in on-base housing. If no houses are available on post
				then you are eligible to recieve Basic Housing Allowance, a tax-free monthly housing allowance, that allows you to live in a house or apartment off-post of your choosing, as long as the rent falls within the bounds of the BAH.<br>
				If you are a single soldier with no kids, depending on your rank, you will live inside the barracks allotted to each company. These barracks differ on each installation, but most will be along the lines of a college dorm. You will share a room
				with a roommate.</p></li>
		<li><strong>Free Flights</strong><br>
			<p>The Military offers something along the lines of "free flights" to Military personnel and their families. If you live near an installation that has MAC flights (military flights), you can sign up on a waiting list. Mind you, sometimes these
				waiting lists are quite long, so make sure you plan ahead and check the itineraries of the flights and sign up early. These flights travel all across the globe and are usually transporting some sort of military equipment.</p></li>
